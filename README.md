# ùÑû Songiton

I would like to store, view and scrape songs (lyrics + chords) easily.

Songiton is the smallest atomic shape of a song, duh.

The project is in its beginnings.

## Scope

### Song store - `songiton-store`
A fast API backend for converting and storing song (chords + lyrics) to a new song format file `.jsong`
- `.jsong` = json with utf8 chars allowed, with a special structure
- also might allow database storage

### Song viewer - `songiton-ui`
Probably using react-native framework `expo` to be android+iphone+web able.

Possible I will try to use `kivy` package to write android app with better then "viewing only" capability.


### Song scraper - `songiton-acq`
A possibility.
